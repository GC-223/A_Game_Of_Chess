ok so lets think of our board

how are we going to represent a board

a board is an 8x8 2d array of tiles
    
    each tile has a piece on it
    
    the board should handle logic such as checking if a move is legal
    
    handle checks and winning condition
    
    function to update board after a legal move
    
    a way to print the board
    
    constructor
    

each tile
    may or may not have a piece
    
    i guess a boolean to tell if the space is occupied
    
    getter and setter for the piece
    
Piece
    each piece has a color
        lets try and use a boolean instead of using an enum to represent pieces
    
    each piece has a symbol for how we want them to print
    
    each piece has a function to check if move is legal for that specific piece
    
Maybe we have a class to handles coordinates


ok so to handle move input
we are going to need some way to get move input from the use
lets put this in a namespace

    get location of piece they want to move
    
    get location of where they want to move that piece
    
    they should enter using chess notation
    there should be some basic error handling for invalid coordinate inputs
    
    just some basic error handling
    so the string must have a length of 2 - NO more and no less
        
    there is no need to specify the type of piece when moving it
        
    the first element of the string must be a char between 'A' and 'H' inclusive
    the second element of the string must be a number between 1 and 8






Change the piece on the tile --- Don't change the attributes of the piece on that tile
