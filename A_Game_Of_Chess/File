lets start off with a basic representation of the board

chessBoard class
    this is an 8x8 array of TILES
    
    responsible for the initial setup of the board
    
    detecting if a king is in check
        and if in check then it should block all moves that don't take it out of check
    
    detecting winning conditions
    
    
    
TILE class
    
    the board is made up of tiles
    
    a boolean to represent if the tile is occupied or not
    
    perhaps we give the chess coordinates to the tile?
    
    and i guess we would n
    

Piece class
    
    responsible for many things
    
    should have the name of the piece
    
    symbol/board representation of piece
    
    checking if a move is legal or not for that specific piece
    
    should also have a color (boolean?) for each piece
