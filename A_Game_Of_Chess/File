ok so lets think of our board

how are we going to represent a board

a board is an 8x8 2d array of tiles
    
    each tile has a piece on it
    
    the board should handle logic such as checking if a move is legal
    
    handle checks and winning condition
    
    function to update board after a legal move
    
    a way to print the board
    
    constructor
    

each tile
    may or may not have a piece
    
    i guess a boolean to tell if the space is occupied
    
    getter and setter for the piece
    
Piece
    each piece has a color
    
    each piece has a symbol for how we want them to print
    
    each piece has a function to check if move is legal for that specific piece
    
Maybe we have a class to handles coordinates




we cannot change a specific pieces color and symbol

we can change the specific piece in a tile



Change the piece on the tile --- Don't change the attributes of the piece on that tile
